Given the following objects array:

const students = [
{ id: 1, name: "Luca", surname: "Rossi", age: 20, hobby: 'gamer'},
{ id: 2, name: "Mario", surname: "Bianchi", age: 24, hobby: 'sportsman'},
{ id: 3, name: "Giovanna", surname: "Brambilla", age: 26, hobby: 'gamer'},
{ id: 4, name: "Carmelo", surname: "Verdi", age: 18, hobby: 'photographer'},
];

Create a function that iterates over the array and gives the following output:

Luca

Mario
Never give up!
Giovanna
Life Is a Game, Play to Win!
Carmelo
A picture is worth a thousand words!
The youngest is Ã¨ Carmelo
The longest surname is Brambilla

Then add a new student at the third place of the array:

{ id: 5, name: "Elena", surname: "Pappalardo", age: 23, hobby: 'photographer'}

Run the function one more time. You should get the following output:

Luca
Life Is a Game, Play to Win!
Mario
Never give up!
Elena
A picture is worth a thousand words!
Giovanna
Life Is a Game, Play to Win!
Carmelo
A picture is worth a thousand words!
The youngest is Carmelo

Each phrase is related to the students hobbies.
